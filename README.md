# SODING-Todo-App
  I have used MEAN(MongoDB,ExpressJS,AngularJS,NodeJS) Stack and Bootstrap Framework(for styling) to build this Application 

## How to Install and Run the application
  * Install NodeJS into your computer if you haven't installed already.
  * Install MongoDB into your computer if you haven't installed already.
  * Now Start your MongoDB server with terminal from where you have installed by typing **mongod** some might have setup a path like me **mongod --dbpath==yourlocalpath**
  * Clone this Repository or Download into your system.
  * Open the Download folder.
  * Open the Terminal and set path to the download folder and type npm install. Wait for few minutes so that installation will be done.
  * Once all the installations are done type npm run in your terminal. The application will start Running.
  * Open your browser and type the URL [localhost:3000](localhost:3000)

## How it Works
  * An user will be provided with two fields one to enter his task name and an another to enter his task Description.
  * Once he entered his informations he can click the **Add Task button** to add his task.
  * Your Exisiting Task Lists will be displayed in the existing tasks section which contains the task you have added before as well as the recent ones which you have added.
  * The Lists will be displayed in a table format with **List ID,Name,Description,Created At,Updated At**.
  * An **User** can **Edit** the Task by clicking the **Edit button**. Once **User** clicks the **Edit** button two fields will appear one will contain the **Name** of the task and an another one will contain **Description** of the task. 
  * There will be two buttons **Update** and **Cancel** once the user updated the details he can click the **Update** button to **Update** the task. Sometimes an **User** might have mistakenly clicked **Update** button when he has no intention to **Update** the task at that point they can click **Cancel** button to **Cancel** the operation.
  * An **User** can also **Delete** the Task by clicking **Delte** button
