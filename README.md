# SODING-Todo-App


## How it Works
  * An user will be provided with two fields one to enter his task name and an another to enter his task Description.
  * Once he entered his informations he can click the **Add Task button** to add his task.
  * Your Exisiting Task Lists will display the existing tasks which you have added before as well as the recent ones which you have added.
  * The Lists will be displayed in a table format with **List ID,Name,Description,CreatedAt,UpdatedAt**.
  * An **User** can **Edit** the Task by clicking the **Edit button**. Once **User** clicks the **Edit** button two fields will appear one will contain the **Name** of the task and an another one will contain **Description** of the task. 
  * There will be two buttons **Update** and **Cancel** once the user updated the details he can click the **Update** button to **Update** the task. Sometimes an **User** might have mistakenly clicked **Update** button when he has no intention to **Update** the task at that point they can click **Cancel** button to **Cancel** the operation.
  * An **User** can also **Delete** the Task by clicking **Delte** button
